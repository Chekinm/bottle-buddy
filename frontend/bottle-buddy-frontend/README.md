# Bottle-buddy front-end app.

This is the front-end of my Bottle Buddy project, built using React. I've used the Mapbox GL JS library to handle maps and geodata. For design, I've incorporated Bootstrap and Font Awesome React libraries.

The project is a work in progress. You can find functional parts deployed here: [bottle-buddy-project](insert_link_here). Please be patient as it takes around 3-5 minutes for the project to wake up on render.com (due to the free plan). After that, you can explore the current stage of the project.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
